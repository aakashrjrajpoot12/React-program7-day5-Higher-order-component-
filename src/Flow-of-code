step1>>In index.js we are rendering APP.js
Step2>>In App.js we are rendering HOCDemo.js
Step3>> Inside HOCDemo we are returning Clickcounter.js
step4>>Clickcounter is component
we are passing Clickcounter as agrument to IncrementAge
NOTE:we know that'"-HOC are function based components which takes component as argument and return component with added features."

Step5: Increment age is function component
We had already two arguments inside IncrementAge (Clickcounter,5)

step6:Inside IncrementAge CompArgument=Clickcounter,iCustomValue=5) compare from
Clickcounter.js last line

because IncrementAge is component so we have its render which returns  React Fragment,
**React Fragment is a feature in React that allows you to return multiple elements from a React component by allowing you to group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM.
** div (no need to create an extra DOM node)
